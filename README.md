# 🍉Fruit Ninja Game (Python)

A simple yet engaging Fruit Ninja clone implemented in Python using Pygame, inspired by DataFlair’s tutorial. Slice flying fruits with your mouse while avoiding bombs and racing against lives and time.

### 🚀 Features
Launches fruit items (melon, orange, pomegranate, guava) at randomized angles and speeds.
Bomb items appear occasionally—slicing more than 3 bombs ends the game.
Score tracking and player lives display during gameplay.
Simple collision detection: slicing fruits increases score; slicing bombs deducts a life.
Dynamic sprite updates: whole fruits replaced with cut images upon slicing.

### 🧱 Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame library installed via pip install pygame

### 🛠️ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Fruit_Ninja_Game_Python.git
